# Procedural Terrain Generation

This repository contains code for generating procedural terrain using **Three.js** and **GLSL**. It leverages the power of modern 3D rendering and shader programming to create dynamic, realistic, and customizable terrain in the browser.

## Features

- Procedural terrain generation with adjustable parameters using lil GUI.
- Realistic rendering using Three.js.
- Custom shaders written in GLSL for fine-grained control over terrain appearance.
- Interactive 3D visualization in the browser.
- Lightweight and easy to integrate

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core logic and integration with Three.js.
- **Three.js**: A powerful library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser.
- **GLSL**: Custom shaders for procedural terrain generation and effects.
- **HTML/CSS**: For setting up the basic structure and styling of the interface.

## Getting Started
